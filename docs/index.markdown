## What?

Currently, some citizens stand on the sidewalk in downtown to protest 
and show our disapproval to either recent political events/decisions/actions
or just the current Trump presidential administration in general.  
We believe that this president and, by extension, his administration is 
causing egregious harm to our country and to the world at large.
Eveyone that attends voices individual concerns, but it seems we are in general
agreement.

The poster shown on this page is one of the images posted to various social media
about this event.  
There is no central organization, to my knowledge, but I believe the poster
expresses the general concerns of those that attend.


## Why?


> ### "A waste of time and resources"
\- quote from a city official

Well, that's a fun statement.
But I think it's an opinion based on their perspective. 

If you believe the goal of the protests is to 
"make the federal government realize the error 
of their ways and repent!", then yeah, these
protests would be a gigantic waste of time. 

However, I don't think anyone that attends these expects
anything close to that. 
I believe the only things we are sure of are:
1. We always get more positive responses than negative responses[^pos-v-neg],
2. We feel community when meeting together,
3. Doing **nothing** achieves **nothing**.


### Personally
I felt like I was starting to go a little bit crazy 
before I these protests started up.

Siloed at my house, it felt as if I was seeing bad things happening but no one else cared.  

Seeing other people spending their a portion of their Friday protesting made me feel a little less restless
because I was no longer alone in my head.

I actually get out more because of this.  
I talk to more people.   
I spend slightly more money.  
(I'm usually doing business locally anyways.)

In all honesty, this one event has potentially contributed positively to the local economy. 
So, if you needed a purely economic argument, maybe there is one to make. 

#### Footnotes
[^pos-v-neg]: This is a bit of a biased measurement, as I count a "honk" as generally positive, and any other interaction takes more effort on the part of drivers. We regularly get positive reactions at 4-7x the rate of negative reactions. Maybe that discrepancy is due to the difference in effort, but maybe not.
