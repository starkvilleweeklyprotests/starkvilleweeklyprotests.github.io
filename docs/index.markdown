## What?

Local citizens stand on the sidewalk in downtown to protest weekly (12-1pm on Fridays).
This is to show our disapproval of either recent political events/decisions/actions
or just the current presidential administration in general.  

We believe that this president and his administration is 
causing harm to our country and to the world at large.
Eveyone that attends voices individual concerns but are in general
agreement with this understanding.

The poster shown on this page is one of the images posted to various social media
about this event.  
There is no central organization, but the poster represents the general ethos of most of us.


## Why?


> ### "A waste of time and resources"
\- Paraphrased statement from a city official regarding the weekly protests[^statement]

Well, that's a fun comment.  
But it is an opinion based on one's perspective. 

If you believe the goal of the protests is to 
"make the federal government realize the error 
of their ways and repent!", then yeah, these
protests would be a gigantic waste of time. 

However, I don't think anyone that attends these expects
anything close to that. 
I believe some of the only things we are sure of are:
1. We always get more positive responses than negative responses[^pos-v-neg],
2. We feel more community when meeting together,
3. __Doing__ _nothing_ __achieves__ _nothing_.


## Where can I find more info?

I plan to update this website over time.  
Information is currently posted in various spaces on 
social media, but you likely found this website through 
something like that anyways.

#### Footnotes
[^statement]: Just for disclosure, I was not personally present when this comment was made. I had to paraphrase from a retelling and don't have any of the full context or nuance.
[^pos-v-neg]: This is a bit of a biased measurement, as I count a "honk" as generally positive, and any other interaction takes more effort on the part of drivers. We regularly get positive reactions at 4-7x the rate of negative reactions. Maybe that discrepancy is due to the difference in effort required, but maybe not.
